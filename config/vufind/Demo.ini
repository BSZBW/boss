; This section can be used to create fake holdings for specific records. The
; key is the record ID, the value is a JSON document containing an array of
; objects representing holdings records. See the demo driver's getRandomHolding()
; method for a list of fields that are supported. Any omitted fields will be
; overwritten with random results from getRandomHolding.

; This mechanism is primarily intended for use with automated testing.
